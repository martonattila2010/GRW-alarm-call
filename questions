COR1: Do louder GRWs get parasited more often?
- Does a correlation exist between the reaction of GRW males and females to observer (boots.grwm and boots.grwf) and the binomial probability of beeing parasited?
- We use boots.grw instead of playback because we have more data for this variable from 2013, 2014, 2018.
- Since the variable parasite is binomial, we will use a glmer with binomial distribution

parasite  ~ boots.grw
          + total.eggs
          + j.date
          + j.laying.date
          + mminutes
          + nestday
          + (1|site)
          + (1|observer)
          + (1|nestid)
