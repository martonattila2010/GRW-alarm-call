Files:

DFx2b.csv contains  (1) great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus, GRW from hereafter) nest checking data from 2013, 2014 and 2018, 
                    (2) great reed warbler nest characteristics from 2018
                    (3) male and female great reed warbler alarm call intensity data to observer and to dummy plastic cuckoo from 2018
                    (4) male and female common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus CC from hereafter) reactions to GRW alarm call from 2018. All experiment were performed near Apaj village, central Hungary.
